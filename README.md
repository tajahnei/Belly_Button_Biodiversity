# Plot.ly Homework - Belly Button Biodiversity

![Bacteria by filterforge.com](static/images/bacteria.png)

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


 
Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
Adapt the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.
